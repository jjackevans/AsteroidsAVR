# Asteroid Game

## Introduction

> Asteroids is a retro arcade-style game that requires the player to navigate a pixel spaceship through an asteroid field, while collecting fuel cells.

> The player can select from three different gamemodes: normal, difficult and impossible. 
> Harder gameplays are more fast paced, and reward more points per fuel cell.
> Each fuel cell must be reached before the time-bar runs out or the game will end.

> If an mSD-card is located in the device, the high-score within the game will be saved and displayed to the user.

## Installation

> Use the included makefile (AVR-GCC 5.4+), or use dfu-programmer to write the fortuna.hex directly to your LaFortuna board.
